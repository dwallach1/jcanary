# jcanary (JSON Canaries)

Verify your API data contract with just a JSON config file. Easily add integration tests
to your CI pipelines with no custom code, just config files.

Take in a JSON config and perform verification of web server functionality.

**Motivation**: when building a new service and constantly making changes, we want to verify integration tests; however, these can be cumbersome to write and maintain. `jcanary` offers a solution to abstract your tests to JSON and have this define how you manage your integration tests.
